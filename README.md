# Elixa Discord Bot Repository

Welcome to the repository for Elixa, your friendly Discord bot!

## About Elixa

Elixa is a versatile Discord bot designed to enhance your server experience. From moderation tools to fun commands, Elixa has got you covered.

## Repository Information

This repository serves as the base for Elixa's "memes" command functionality. However, it's designed to be flexible. Users have the option to configure Elixa to use their own repository, enabling them to customize and expand its capabilities.

### How to Configure

To configure Elixa with your own repository:

1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account.
2. Deploy Elixa to your server.
3. In discord, write the command /config 'Comando Memes' 'paste here your github repo URL'.
4. Optionally, customize Elixa's functionality to suit your server's needs.

### Adding Your Own Memes

Users can also add their own memes! Simply add your "meme" files (any photo extension file) to the main directory in your Github repo.
